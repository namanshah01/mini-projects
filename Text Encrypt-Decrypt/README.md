# Password Encrypt-Decrypt
Contains 2 scripts, encrypt.py and decrypt.py which encrypt and decrypt a text file respectively without using an external module
- encrypt.py encodes the text with a particular key, and gives the user an option to either remember it or save it as a text file
- decrypt.py decodes the text file, using a saved key if any, or asks the user to enter the key to decrypt the file
